WinVolAuto Plugin Forensics Guide

Purpose
- Help investigators understand how each plugin supports common forensic goals
- Provide quick, practical steps to run plugins and interpret results

How To Use
- Open Dashboard, select plugins from the tree, set options, run analysis
- Review Results and Process Tree; generate JSON/PDF from Reports tab
- Enable AI Risk Probability to rank suspicious PIDs and highlight risk

Windows Internal Plugins (Sumit K.K.)
- internal.win.cmdline
  - Finds risky command lines: encoded payloads, web downloads, living-off-the-land usage
  - Use when triaging initial access or execution; looks for -enc, certutil, bitsadmin, mshta, etc.
  - Action: Investigate PIDs with suspicious args; pivot to malfind, netscan, dlllist
- internal.win.pstree
  - Highlights orphan processes and unusual parent-child pairs
  - Use to spot process lineage anomalies (e.g., services.exe spawning powershell.exe)
  - Action: Confirm legitimacy of parent; dump child process memory for analysis
- internal.win.kernel_scan
  - Summarizes kernel callbacks that may indicate hooks or rootkit behavior
  - Use when suspecting stealth techniques beyond userland injection
  - Action: Cross-check unsigned drivers; correlate with callbacks for rootkit indicators
- internal.win.persistence_scan
  - Flags services loading from Temp/AppData and other nonstandard paths
  - Use for persistence discovery and cleanup planning
  - Action: Validate binaries and paths; search autoruns; compare with registry autorun keys
- internal.win.text_scan
  - Finds text-like files in memory, shows path, file name, and preview text
  - Use to collect notes, scripts, logs left by attackers; triage folder distribution
  - Action: Review previews; export notable items; correlate with cmdline and netscan findings

Linux Internal Plugins (Sumit K.K.)
- internal.linux.pslist
  - Flags execution from /tmp or /dev/shm and root shells
  - Use to quickly identify suspicious execution paths and privileged shells
  - Action: Inspect binaries and paths; capture volatile artifacts for IR
- internal.linux.bash
  - Summarizes risky bash history commands
  - Use to reconstruct attacker actions and intent
  - Action: Review samples; follow leads for downloads, encoders, and lateral movement
- internal.linux.check_syscall
  - Counts hooked syscalls indicating kernel rootkits
  - Use when suspecting kernel-level tampering
  - Action: Investigate loaded modules; verify integrity; capture for offline analysis
- internal.linux.elfs
  - Flags ELF modules loaded from transient folders
  - Use to catch runtime-loaded artifacts and stealthy modules
  - Action: Map modules to processes; dump and scan with AV or sandbox tools

Core Volatility Plugins (Windows)
- windows.pslist / windows.psscan / windows.pstree
  - Baseline processes, hidden processes, and hierarchy
  - Use for execution mapping and DKOM detection
- windows.malfind
  - Identifies injected code; critical for process compromise confirmation
- windows.netscan
  - Shows active and recently closed connections; trace C2 or exfil routes
- windows.dlllist / windows.handles
  - Enumerate modules and open handles; find injected libraries and suspicious files
- windows.svcscan
  - Enumerates services; identify abnormal locations or names for persistence
- windows.filescan / windows.dumpfiles
  - Carves file objects and extracts artifacts from memory for offline analysis

Reports And AI
- JSON/PDF reports include plugin descriptions and structured tables
- AI Risk Probability ranks PIDs based on signals; MITRE mapping explains context
- Malware Capabilities summarize likely adversary functions with evidence

Best Practices
- Run baseline plugins first, then targeted ones based on findings
- Keep AI Risk Probability enabled to focus quickly on top risks
- Verify findings with multiple plugins (e.g., cmdline + malfind + netscan)
- Export suspicious artifacts for offline reverse engineering and AV scanning
