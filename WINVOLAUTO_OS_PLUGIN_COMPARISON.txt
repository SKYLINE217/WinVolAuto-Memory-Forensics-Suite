WinVolAuto – OS Plugin Comparison and Missing Coverage (Actionable)

Overview
- This document compares current plugin coverage across Windows, Linux, and macOS in WinVolAuto and lists missing categories you should include via Volatility 3 plugins (or their OS‑specific equivalents discovered at runtime).
- Basis: Current workflow in UI and engine (Windows defaults in main workflow; Linux/mac minimal defaults in Dashboard).

Windows
- Present (wired by default)
  - Process enumeration: pslist
  - Hidden process detection: psscan
  - Network artifacts: netscan
  - Code injection detection: malfind
  - Modules/handles: dlllist, handles
  - Services/callbacks: svcscan, callbacks
  - Dump/extract for VT: dumpfiles
  - Optional: VadYaraScan when enabled
- Missing (recommended to include)
  - Command lines: cmdline (use by default; risk already ingests it)
  - Parent‑child tree: pstree (for hierarchy and better triage)
  - Kernel drivers/modules and hooks: drivers/modules scans, SSDT/IDT/inline hook checks
  - Registry/persistence artifacts: autoruns‑like coverage (Run keys, Scheduled Tasks, WMI subscriptions)
  - Signature trust checks: PE signature validation for DLLs/drivers (pair with dump analysis)
  - Memory maps: per‑process VAD/mappings summary for injection heuristics
  - Timeline correlation: unified event view (process/net/injection/persistence)

Linux
- Present (Dashboard defaults)
  - Process enumeration: pslist
  - Shell history: bash
  - Syscall integrity: check_syscall
  - ELF enumeration: elfs
- Missing (recommended to include)
  - Hidden processes: psscan‑equivalent for Linux memory images
  - Network artifacts: netstat/netscan‑equivalent for sockets and endpoints
  - Open files and sockets: lsof‑equivalent views
  - Kernel modules/hooks: loaded modules listing and hook/LSM/kprobe checks
  - Persistence: cron jobs, systemd unit anomalies, rc scripts, SSH authorized_keys anomalies
  - Memory maps and injection analogs: per‑process maps and shared object injection indicators
  - YARA scanning: per‑process or region‑based scanning
  - Parent‑child/process tree: pstree‑equivalent and anomaly detection

macOS
- Present (Dashboard defaults)
  - Process enumeration: pslist
  - Shell history: bash
  - Syscall integrity: check_syscall
- Missing (recommended to include)
  - Network artifacts: netstat‑equivalent for macOS
  - Open files: lsof‑equivalent
  - Kernel extensions (kext): listing and trust/codesign status
  - Persistence: launchd plists, login items, quarantine events
  - Hidden processes and hierarchy anomalies: pstree‑equivalent and detection
  - Memory maps/injection analogs: region analysis for userland injection
  - Codesign/notarization checks: trust validation for binaries/modules
  - YARA scanning: memory region scanning for macOS processes

Cross‑OS Gaps (High Priority)
- Unified timeline correlator: build time‑ordered events from process, network, injection, persistence for all OSes
- Kernel‑space analytics: drivers/modules/hooks across OSes (Windows first, then Linux/mac)
- Trainable models: integrate offline‑trained risk models with calibration, per‑PID scoring
- IoC exports: STIX/TAXII and SIEM‑friendly CSV/JSON; UI export buttons

Action Plan (Plugins/Categories to Add)
- Windows
  - Enable cmdline and pstree by default
  - Add kernel driver/module enumeration and hook detection plugins
  - Add registry/persistence artifact plugins (Run keys, tasks, WMI, services deep‑dive)
  - Add memory map/VAD summary per process
  - Pair PE signature checks with dump analysis results
- Linux
  - Add netstat/netscan and lsof equivalents
  - Add hidden processes, kernel modules/hooks checks
  - Add persistence scans (cron/systemd/rc)
  - Add memory maps/injection heuristics and pstree equivalents
  - Add YARA scanning support
- macOS
  - Add netstat and lsof equivalents
  - Add kext listing and trust checks
  - Add launchd/login items/quarantine persistence scans
  - Add hidden process/pstree equivalents and memory region analysis
  - Add codesign/notarization checks and YARA scanning

Notes
- Specific plugin names vary by Volatility version and environment. Use dynamic discovery to locate OS‑specific equivalents and include them in the default presets for each OS.
- Once added, wire outputs into RiskAnalyzer (features, MITRE mapping), CapabilityAnalyzer (capability evidence), Timeline correlator (events), and Reports (tables/sections).
